                <div class="boldsection">Hello! My Name is Zachary Polof 
                    and I am a developer in training!
                </div> 
                I am a current service manager in the automotive industry, who is looking for a career change into tech.
                I have always had a passion for technology and design from a young age, originally going to school for
                3D autocad and design. I strayed from that path and found that although the rest of the world is fun,
                my passion and drive lies in a new found area for me of programming and coding. I orignally started
                to develop my programming skills on a self taught path using Zero To Mastery as well as many other 
                online resources. After a few months trying the self taught route I opted to enroll in the 
                University of Central Florida's online bootcamp to gain a more direct experience route in several languages,
                including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API's, Jquery, Node, Express, MySQL, React among others! I'm set to graduate later 
                this year in 2024 and look forward to a bright future in programmin. My main interest's lie in full stack development
                , web design, with a follow up in the future into cloud architecture(hopefully).
