          <p><strong>Hello! My Name is Zachary Polof and I am an entry level full stack developer!</strong><br><br>
            I currently work full time in the automotive industry.
            I have always had a passion for technology and design from a young age, originally going to school for
            3D autocad and design. <br><br>
            Originally developing my programming skills on a self taught path using Zero To Mastery as well as many other 
            online resources. After a few months trying the self taught route I opted to enroll in the 
            University of Central Florida's online bootcamp to gain a more direct experience route in several languages,
            including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API's, Jquery, Node, Express, MySQL, React among others! <br><br>I'm set to graduate later 
            this year in 2024 and look forward to a bright future in programming. My main interest's lie in full stack development
            , web design, with a follow up in the future into cloud architecture(hopefully).
